# This project was created by Tim Bell in December, 2015.  This is my final
project for the CVTC Programming Fundamentals class.  This program was designed
as a math game for children.  You seletct the type of problem you would like to
work with; addition, subtraction, multiplication or division.  Then the program
will loop through that type of problems 3 times and tell you if your answer was
correct or incorrect.
